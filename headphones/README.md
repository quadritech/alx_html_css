# 🌐 HTML & CSS From Scratch Project

This project is part of the **ALX Frontend Curriculum**, focused on building a complete and fully responsive web page **from scratch** using only **HTML** and **CSS**, with an emphasis on **accessibility** and **responsive design** best practices.

## 📌 Project Objective

The goal is to **recreate a full web page** to match a designer's specification (provided via Figma) — **without using any external libraries or frameworks**.

### 🎯 Key Requirements
- No external CSS frameworks (e.g., Bootstrap, Tailwind)
- No JavaScript (unless explicitly allowed later)
- Pixel-perfect match to the Figma design
- Fully responsive and mobile-friendly
- Must follow web accessibility best practices

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, Media Queries)**
- **Figma** (for design reference)
- **Font files** (custom fonts such as Source Sans Pro, Spin Cycle OT)
